# Disaster-Management
To predict disasters and prevent loss of lives.

Data can be collected about mobility of users during disasters to see how much impact the disasters in the particular regions actually did. This can be done through the users' social media location details through their posts during the disasters.

Data can be collected extensively to predict the next expected disaster, so communities in the area can stay at the tip of their feet and be ready for any forecast around the predicted timeframe.

Disaster management can be portrayed well so that people know the measures to be taken at the time of an impending disaster.
